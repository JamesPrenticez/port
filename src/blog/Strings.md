Both methods achieve the same result in converting the variables start_date and end_date to strings before passing them to the Date constructor. However, there are some differences in how they handle certain cases:

1. String() constructor: This method explicitly converts any type to a string. If the argument passed to String() is null or undefined, it will return "null" or "undefined", respectively. This method is straightforward and usually preferred for converting values to strings.

```js
const stringValue = String(123); // "123"
```

2. toString() method: This method is invoked on an object to get its string representation. If the object is null or undefined, calling toString() on it would result in an error (TypeError: Cannot read property 'toString' of null). This method is useful when you are sure that the variable is not null or undefined.

```js
const stringValue = (123).toString(); // "123"
```

For your case, where you're dealing with query parameters, either method should work fine because query parameters are typically strings or undefined. However, using String() is a bit safer in cases where the variable might be null or undefined, as it handles those cases gracefully by returning the strings "null" or "undefined".

The flow you described – merging a feature branch into a dev branch, then into a stage branch, and finally into a prod branch – is a variation of a popular branching strategy called Git Flow. It's designed to allow teams to manage features, releases, and hotfixes in a structured manner. Here are some points to consider regarding this workflow:

Pros:
Separation of Environments: Each branch (dev, stage, prod) represents a different environment. This can help ensure that features and changes are tested at multiple levels before reaching production.

Release Management: With a dedicated stage or release branch, it becomes easier to aggregate features for a release, test them collectively, and prepare release notes or documentation.

Hotfixes: If critical bugs are found in production, they can be quickly fixed in the prod branch (or a dedicated hotfix branch) and merged back without having to wait for other features or changes in dev or stage to be ready.

Cons:
Overhead: As you mentioned, the process can feel repetitive, especially if there's a lot of back-and-forth or if conflicts arise frequently.

Delay: Features might take longer to reach production because they need to pass through multiple stages.

Complexity: New team members might find this flow confusing initially, and it might take time for them to adapt.

Alternative:
A simplified alternative to the described flow is the Trunk Based Development (TBD) approach:

Short-lived feature branches: Features are developed in branches but are merged directly into the main trunk (often main or master) as soon as they are done.

Continuous Integration: The main trunk is continuously tested, and any breaking change is fixed immediately.

Continuous Deployment/Continuous Delivery: Changes in the main trunk can be deployed to production frequently, sometimes multiple times a day.

This approach reduces the merging overhead but demands a strong testing infrastructure and rapid response to any issues.

Conclusion:
The best approach often depends on the team's size, the project's complexity, and the organization's culture and requirements:

If your team values structured releases, detailed testing at multiple stages, and clear separation of environments, the Git Flow or similar strategies can be beneficial.

If you feel the overhead is unnecessary and you have the infrastructure to support frequent integrations and deployments, you might lean towards a Trunk Based Development approach or a simplified Git Flow.

It might be worth discussing the pain points and inefficiencies you're experiencing with your team and considering if modifications to your current strategy can alleviate them.

"Better" can be subjective when it comes to development workflows, as what works best often depends on the project's nature, team size, company culture, and specific requirements. However, let's break down the pros and cons of both Git Flow and Trunk Based Development (TBD) to help inform your decision.

Git Flow:
Pros:

Clear Structure: Git Flow provides a clear, structured process with designated branches for features, releases, and hotfixes.
Separation of Concerns: Different branches can correspond to different environments (e.g., development, staging, production), allowing for staged deployments and testing.
Flexibility: Can accommodate larger teams working on different features simultaneously.
Hotfixes: Provides a clear process for applying urgent fixes to production.
Cons:

Overhead: The process can become complex and cumbersome, especially if there's frequent merging and many long-lived branches.
Delay in Deployments: Features might take longer to reach production as they need to pass through multiple stages.
Trunk Based Development (TBD):
Pros:

Simplicity: Developers work in short-lived branches or directly in the trunk, reducing merge complexities.
Fast Iteration: Allows for more frequent integrations and faster delivery of features to production.
Avoids "Merge Hell": With continuous merging and fewer long-lived branches, the team avoids big, problematic merges.
Continuous Integration: Enforces a culture of continuously testing and validating changes.
Cons:

Requires Strong CI/CD: To be effective, TBD relies heavily on a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
Potential Instability: Without careful testing, the trunk can become unstable.
Scale: For very large teams, managing frequent merges into the trunk can be challenging.
Which is better?
For startups and projects that require rapid iteration, TBD can be more attractive because of its emphasis on quick delivery and simpler branching strategy.

For larger teams or projects with structured release cycles, Git Flow can provide the necessary structure and separation of concerns.

Ultimately, the best approach is one that aligns with the team's goals and capabilities. It's also worth noting that many teams adopt a hybrid approach, taking elements from both Git Flow and TBD that best suit their needs. As with many things in software development, regular reflection and iteration on your processes are key, allowing you to adapt and refine your workflow over time.
